        When no one else can understand me<br />
        When everything I do is wrong<br />
        You give me hope and consolation<br />
        You give me strength to carry on<br />
        And you're always there to lend a hand<br />
        In everything I do<br />
        That's the wonder<br />
        The Wonder of U!
